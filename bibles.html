    <h1>Bibles</h1>
    <p>Several kinds of Bible translations from the Middle Ages and later periods are included in the Old French Bible project. These include translations of individual books such as the Psalms, loose <q>translations</q> of Bible stories and passages into French verse, and large-scale prose translations of many books or the entire Bible.</p>
    <p>The first stage of the project focuses on the 13<sup>th</sup>-century Old French Bible, a translation produced probably between 1220 and 1250 in Paris or somewhere nearby. We don't know exactly who produced it, although it has been proposed that it was commissioned either by the University of Paris or by the French royal family (see Sneddon, Clive R. 2019. The Old French Bible. In Jeanette Beer (ed.), <em>A Companion to Medieval Translation</em>, 23–36. Amsterdam: Arc Humanities Press).
