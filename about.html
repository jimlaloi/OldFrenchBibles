    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>The Old French Bibles project began in 2021 at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. Dr. Jim Law, the project supervisor, began transcribing medieval French Bible translations with his students in a History of French course. Since then, multiple students and research assistants have worked on the project in collaboration with the BYU Office of Digital Humanities. The project has been generously funded by the BYU College of Humanities.</p>
